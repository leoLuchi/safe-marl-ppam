### Requirements

Each experiment has its own `requirements.txt`, which can be found in the corresponding folder. 

All experiments can be run with Python 3.11.4. We highly suggest to setup different virtual environments, one per experiment.

To create a virtual environment and install the requirements:
 
	python -m venv path/to/venv
	source path/to/venv/bin/activate
   	pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd cocktail-party
    pip install -e .
